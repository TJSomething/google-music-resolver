##Usage

###Installation

Requirements:

* Unofficial Google Music API [Unofficial Google Music API](https://github.com/simon-weber/Unofficial-Google-Music-API), currently only version < 2012.11.09 supported. Check Morguls repo for a [branch](https://github.com/Morgul/google-music-resolver) that works with the lastest API.
* [keyring](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/keyring)
* Python 2.7 or 3.3 (other versions might work, but are untested
* [Tomahawk](http://www.tomahawk-player.org/)

###Getting Started

Start Tomahawk, open setting, go to "Resolvers", click "add from file" and choose the
`gmusic-resolver.py` script (on linux systems `/usr/bin/gmusic-resolver.py`). Notice the
hypen, not an underscore!

If a little wrench appears on the right hand side at the bottom of the list, the resolver is running.
Click the wrench, enter your credentials and hit OK. Your password is stored in your operating systems
password storage, which might ask for permission now. On every start, the resolver fetches your library
information which may take a few seconds before its ready to resolve.

Tomahawk does not provide a way to tell if the login was succesful or not. Check the logfile under
`~/.local/share/Tomahawk/gmusic-resolver.log` for warnings and errors in case it doesnt work correctly.
